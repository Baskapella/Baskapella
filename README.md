# Hi, I'm Basit! 👋
### Offensive Security Engineer | Penetration Tester | VAPT Specialist | QA Tester

Passionate about offensive security, Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing (VAPT). I systematically identify, validate, and remediate vulnerabilities across web applications, cloud environments, Active Directory networks, and internal systems. My work bridges offensive security, penetration testing, and quality assurance blending creativity, analytical thinking, and precision.

## 👨‍💻 About Me
I am an **Offensive Security Engineer** focused on proactive defense through adversarial simulation and deep vulnerability analysis. My philosophy is simple: **You can't defend what you don't understand.**

I specialize in testing web applications, cloud environments, Active Directory networks, and internal systems to identify and remediate vulnerabilities. I document findings clearly and produce actionable remediation guidance.
